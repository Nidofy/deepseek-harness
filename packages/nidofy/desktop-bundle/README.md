# @nidofy/dsh-desktop-bundle

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

This configuration-only bundle installs desktop extras, persistent literal history search, the five official history tools, and opt-in Notebook presets derived from the pinned official compositions. The derived Desktop enrolls it once in the managed profile; later removal and native recovery remain persistent.

## Use this package

The plugin manager selects this bundle in `dsh.profile.bundles`. Its patch enables history and the independent [working-notebook plugin](../working-notebook/README.md). Diagnostics, vision, cache experiments and pets remain opt-in. Official presets remain unchanged. Automatic note organization is initially off and enabled through the notebook switch; legacy Notebook presets remain for saved Sessions and use the same switch. Run `node packages/nidofy/desktop-bundle/generate-context-presets.mjs --check` after an upstream update. Follow the [plugin guide](../desktop-extras/README.md) to enable individual capabilities.

## Model Experience

### Activation

#### What the model sees

The five official history tools plus `notebook_read` and `notebook_update` become available. Notes enter a logged turn-boundary snapshot; history tools return bounded, source-attributed content.

#### Token effect

No model request or token cost occurs on activation.

#### KV Cache effect

Tool schemas change the request prefix; added note snapshots and recalled evidence consume model input tokens.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>

- This private bundle ships with the derived Windows Desktop. It is not an independently published npm distribution.

<a id="dev-note"></a>
### Dev Note

The bundle and plugin have separate package identities because official profile resolution traverses bundle dependencies. No invariant companion is published: this package has no mutable runtime state.
